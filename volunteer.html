          PREP-KC can always use volunteers to help with our math relay events.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are looking for volunteers who feel comfortable working in person this year.
          The event will be held at one of our partner district schools and traditionally runs from 8-2pm on a Saturday.
          Volunteers will work with groups of students either helping with proctoring testing events or new team events.
          If you are able to join us, we would really appreciate your support!
        </p>

        <p>
          A 60-minute proctor training will be scheduled for
          those proctors who have not participated previously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Approximately 300+ students and coaches from over 20 elementary and
          middle schools in the PREP-KC footprint will participate in this
          year's event, and will host students from schools in four of PREP-KCâ€™s
          partner districts: Center, Grandview, Hickman Mills, and Allen Village
          Charter Schools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you so much for considering our request, and please let me know
          if you would like to follow-up with a phone call to get more
          clarification.
