          PREP-KC is requesting proctor support for our Junior Math Relays event
          coming up on May 1, 2021 from 8:45 to 12:00 pm.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are looking for volunteers who feel comfortable on Zoom to proctor
          the event and support our students during this year’s competition.
          Volunteers will work with groups of no more than four students at a
          time for one of the three team competitions that will be happening
          simultaneously. We are asking that proctors report to their Zoom Link
          at 8:30. There will be a 15 minute break in the morning, and we will
          be finished in time for lunch. If you are able to join us, we would
          really appreciate your support!
        </p>

        <p>
          A 60-minute proctor training will be scheduled during late April for
          those proctors who have not participated previously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Approximately 150 students and coaches from over 20 elementary and
          middle schools in the PREP-KC footprint will participate in this
          year's event, and will host students from schools in four of PREP-KC’s
          partner districts: Center, Grandview, Hickman Mills, and Allen Village
          Charter Schools.
        </p>

        <p>
          The awards ceremony will be a virtual celebration on
          <span className="text-color-primary"
            >YOUTUBE Live at 1:00 pm Thursday, May 6</span
          >, where we will celebrate the winners of all of the competitions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you so much for considering our request, and please let me know
          if you would like to follow-up with a phone call to get more
          clarification.
