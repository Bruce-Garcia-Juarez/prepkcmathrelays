    <h1>Exploring the Museum Floor PLans</h1>
    <p>Below you are given various floor plans for the museum. Each each floor plan you need to answer the central question using what you have learned with geometry.
    </p>

    <h1>Floor Plan Basement</h1>
    <p>Below is the bottom floor of the museum. You need to answer 2 questions that are necessary for the heist. First, You need the total area of the bottom floor. As you can see the bottom floor is
        is composed of several triangles and a large perfect square for the entrance along with a side rectangle that holds the stair case the the first floor. Second, you will need to calculate the the total
        length of the yellow line segment. That line represents the exact path that aren't covered by cameras. This will allow you to get from the entrance to the stairs without detection.
