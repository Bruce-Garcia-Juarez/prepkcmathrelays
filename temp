      <h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qBxeTNNoZ0_LVAEH1yYzlmTAdKYo6HWR">Math Madness Tournament Folder</a></h3>
      <p>The folder consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instructions/Guidelines - Please read through and let us know if you have any questions.</li>
        <li>Toss-Up Questions - These are in Google Slides and there are only 30 made - so you will need to make more math questions for your mathematicians.  (HINT - duplicate the slides and just change up the numbers, operation signs, or copy/paste a new problem.)  That way you can add more slides for your game.  Another fun way is to have students create more math problems.  Both the Toss-Up and Bonus Questions are primarily 5th/6th grade level.  Please feel free to create more appropriate grade level math problems as you like.</li>
        <li>Bonus Questions - Again, these are in Google Slides and there are only 15 made - so you will need to make more math questions for your mathematicians.</li>
        <li>Toss-Up and Bonus Questions Answer Keys</li>
        <li>Scorecard - The teams can be created any way you choose (i.e. divide the whole class in 2 teams, 4 teams, 8 teams...).  Just remember to create additional math questions (both Toss-up and Bonus) to last through the quarters and a possible Overtime round.</li>
        <li>8 Team Bracket - This is an example if you choose to play brackets in your competition.  In the Instructions/Guidelines, the link for additional brackets is provided if you want to play a 4 Team Bracket or 6 Team Bracket...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We would love for you to play this with your mathematicians and take pictures of the FUN and COMPETITIVENESS going on!  An idea of the picture could be standing in the back of the class with the big screen showing a Toss-Up or Bonus question in the background and teams of students working on the answer in the foreground?  We would like to display the pictures on the PREP-KC Junior Math Relay Celebration Video.  Please submit the pictures by April 30!</p>

      <p>A BONUS with this folder is that you now have a pre-made math game you can engage your students in around math problem-solving!  You can even add slides for math review!
        Additionally, please feel free to share with fellow grade level colleagues!  Your grade level could hold a Math Madness Grade Level Tournament to see who will be the 2021 Math Madness Champion!  Again, please let us know if you have any questions.</p>
